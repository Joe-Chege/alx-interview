# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Project Description

In this project, the goal is to implement a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' H characters in a text file. The only allowed operations are Copy All and Paste. The objective is to minimize the number of operations required to achieve the desired pattern.

## Project Structure

The project directory includes the following files:

1. **0-minoperations.py**: Contains the implementation of the `minOperations` method.
2. **0-main.py**: A sample main file for testing the `minOperations` method.

## Getting Started

To test the implementation, run the provided main file:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
```

Adjust the input values in the main file to observe different results.

## Method Signature

```python
def minOperations(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' H characters."""
    pass
```

## Example

```python
n = 9
min_operations = minOperations(n)
print(f"Number of operations: {min_operations}")
```

## Expected Output

```
Number of operations: 6
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style compliance
- Proper documentation
- Executable files
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment
