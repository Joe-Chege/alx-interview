# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

### Description

This repository contains the solutions for the Pascal's Triangle project, part of the ALX curriculum.

### Project Details

- **Weight**: 1
- **Duration**: Jan 2, 2024, 6:00 AM - Jan 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: Jan 3, 2024, 12:00 AM

### Tasks Overview

#### Task 0: Pascal's Triangle

- Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of n.
- Returns an empty list if n <= 0
- n is always an integer

### Usage

You can run the provided script `0-main.py` to test the `pascal_triangle()` function. It will generate Pascal's Triangle up to 5 rows as an example.

```bash
./0-main.py
```

### Repository Structure

- GitHub repository: [alx-interview](https://github.com/alx-interview)
- Directory: `0x00-pascal_triangle`
- File: `0-pascal_triangle.py`

## Conclusion

This project provides a Python solution for generating Pascal's Triangle and serves as a practical exercise in algorithmic problem-solving and Python programming.
